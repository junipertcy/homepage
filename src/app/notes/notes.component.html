    The year of 2023, I earned my PhD degree; it is also a year that I had my first traumatic experience.
    I learned that good mental health is the ability to love and to work, at the same time.
    While I was healing toward this goal bit by bit,
    I found some interesting perspectives on "the sea of islands" as a metaphorâ€”in psychotherapy, in politics, and in
    the computer science that I am fond of.
